          <h2>I'm Vengeance</h2>
          <p>Batman calls himself “vengeance” during his early years of crime-fighting because at that point<br>
             he is fuelled by avenging the death of his parents. Bruce is still very much in pain over his parents' death<br>
              at the hands of Gotham's corruption, therefore, he calls himself vengeance because that is his main drive.</p>

            <p>
                Batman has no inherent superhuman powers;
                he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess"
                Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a
                proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage.
                In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's
                greatest crime solver.Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intelle
                being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning.

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime,
            the designs of which usually share a bat motif.Batman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, havin
            the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts, and
            incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.Batman's primary vehicle is the Batmobile, 
            which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with tailfins that suggest a bat's wings.
            Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (later called the "Batwing"), along with various other means of
            transportation.
